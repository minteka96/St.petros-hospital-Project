        <p>
          The Toxicology Department provides specialized care for the
          prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of poisoning and toxic exposures.
          It plays a crucial role in addressing emerging public health concerns,
          including chemical, biological, and environmental hazards.
        </p>
        <p>
          The department was established in 2017 and is Ethiopiaâ€™s pioneering
          national poison center, showcasing the hospital's commitment to the
          International Health Regulations (IHR) of 2005. The center has treated
          over 1,200 poisoned patients, aiming to enhance the quality and
          accessibility of its services to better meet community demands.
