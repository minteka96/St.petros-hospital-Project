      </p>

      <h2>Key Services at SPH HIV Care Center:</h2>
      <h4>HIV Testing and Counseling:</h4>
      <p>
        SPH provides HIV testing and counseling services, helping individuals
        understand their HIV status and supporting them in making informed
        decisions about their health and treatment options.
      </p>
      <h4>Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):</h4>
      <p>
        The center offers ART to people living with HIV, which helps suppress
        the virus, improve immune function, and prevent the transmission of HIV.
        ART is provided free of charge to eligible patients.
      </p>
      <h4>Regular Monitoring (CD4 and Viral Load Testing):</h4>
      <p>
        Regular monitoring through CD4 count and viral load testing is crucial
        for assessing the immune systemâ€™s health and tracking the effectiveness
        of ART. This allows healthcare providers to adjust treatment as
        necessary for optimal results.
      </p>
      <h4>Adherence Support Programs:</h4>
      <p>
        SPH offers adherence support programs to ensure the effectiveness of
        ART. These programs help patients stay consistent with their medication
        regimens, which is essential for viral suppression and overall health
        improvement.
      </p>
      <h4>Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT):</h4>
      <p>
        SPH provides services aimed at preventing the transmission of HIV from
        mother to child during pregnancy, labor, and breastfeeding. This
        includes the administration of ART to pregnant women living with HIV to
        protect both the mother and the baby.
